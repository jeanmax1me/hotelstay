# hotelstay
a airbnb variant to practice the MERN stack, it is my first fullstack App 

if anyone wonder why there are a bunch of Tailwind rules , some CSS-in-JS inline styles, and also some others in .css files. I had an issue with Tailwind config and started doing JS inline styles thinking it would resolves quick, but then when it didn't I just started styling components using selectors and a normal .css file, but after a while I finally resolved the Tailwind issue and now back to Tailwind classes...
